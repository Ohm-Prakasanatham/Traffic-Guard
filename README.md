Traffic route analysis is an influential factor in everyoneâ€™s day to day activity, this investigation endeavour to identify suitable artificial
intelligence mechanisms to predict traffic jam status of a route based on event and weather data. In this analysis of traffic jam prediction
decision support Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU) based deep learning techniques were trained and
tested to predict traffic jams. The primary task of the proposed work is to compare the efficacy and adoptability of these models in
forecasting traffic issues. In this research relevant dataset on past weather conditions, events, and traffic situations are applied for modelling
the prediction process. First, the data is subject for analysis by converting words into numbers and then organized into sequences, which
aids to consider the time aspect of traffic prediction. Both LSTM and GRU models are trained and tested using the target dataset .The
accuracy, precision, and recall metrics were used to realize the model performance in terms of traffic prediction problems. In this analysis,
LSTM attained 87.8 % accuracy and revealed that it is suitable for predicting traffic jam.
